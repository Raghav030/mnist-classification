 In this project, I used the MNIST dataset to train the data of 60,000 handwritten digits, in form of images of 28*28 pixels by Sk-learn and tested the accuracy on 10,000 other images.
 I implemented a logistic regression model and trained my model on the dataset with a split of 8:1.
 The model was fit while minimizing the cross-entropy loss and I got a cross validation score of .958.
